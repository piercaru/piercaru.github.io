I am a Medical Doctor that is pursuing a Ph.D.in Data Science, supervised by Prof. Maurizio Cecconi and Dr. Massimiliano Greco. My university is the Humanitas University in Milan (Italy), that is right in front of the Humanitas Research Hospital, but I am not there at the moment as I am a visiting researcher at the University of Cambridge. The department where I make my researches is the Intensive Care Unit where I try to ask new medical questions that can be answered with machine learning. Our group works mainly with the electronic health records that are now generating a previoulsy unseen large quantity of data and the focus of my research is the clinical trajectory of hospitalized patients, specifically I am interested in clinical deteriorating patients. In simpler words, I observe data from patients that had severe complications during their stay in the hospital and try to understand if it was possible to prevent that event using the data gathered before the episode happened.
